### (Based in Python Documentation)

This project is a personal study (based on the Language documentation) on Data Structures and Algorithms ([first we will see linked list, stack and queues](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-stacks))

[An interesting book online](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/index.html)
