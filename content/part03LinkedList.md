## Definition of Linked List in Python

Linked list in Python provides a logical connection between data elements that are stored in memory in different locations physically. Data elements are stored in nodes along with reference links to the next immediate data element. Logical sequencing of data is achieved in Python through these links in data nodes and the entire gamut of data can be accessed sequentially using these links by navigating from the first data element to the next and so on.

Linked list in Python removes the hassle of pre-defining the memory blocks, provides flexibility to scale up data dynamically, simplifies the data operations, and ensures optimum usage of memory.
